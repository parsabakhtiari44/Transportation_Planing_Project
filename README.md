- The first code, named project-maindata.ipynb, specifically consists of the code prior to building prediction models and operates on the initial dataset (datacsv.csv). However, for the later sections of the code, we needed to create columns for month and day of the week. Therefore, we uploaded a second Excel file containing the columns for month and day of the week (data_month&day.csv) and utilized it in the code.

- The second code, named project-prepareddata.ipynb, exclusively works on the section related to prediction models such as Gradient Boosting, etc. For this purpose, it requires the file (prepared_data.csv) located in the corresponding folder.
